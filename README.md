# Ys Learning Lab Worksheet Generators

Static, no-build homeschool worksheet site. Everything runs client-side:
HTML5 + Tailwind CSS (CDN) + vanilla JS + [pdf-lib](https://pdf-lib.js.org/) (CDN)
for PDF generation. No server, no build step, no analytics beyond whatever
ad script you add yourself.

## Structure

- `index.html` - landing page, links to each tool
- `math.html` / `js/math-generator.js` / `js/math-ui.js` - port of `source/math test advanced.py`
- `japanese.html` / `js/japanese-generator.js` / `js/japanese-ui.js` - port of `source/Hiragana Katakana Test Maker.py`
  (the katakana<->hiragana matching quiz)
- `japanese-practice.html` / `js/japanese-practice-generator.js` / `js/japanese-practice-ui.js` - a separate,
  not-ported-from-Python tool: hiragana handwriting/tracing practice (single character - via a dropdown, not a
  text field, since typing Japanese isn't a given on every device - a whole row/行, or all 46 basic hiragana).
  No stroke-order arrows (accurately sourcing stroke-path data for 46+ characters wasn't worth the risk of
  silently-wrong data) and no answer key / QR / matching-code concept - tracing has nothing to "check". Trace
  boxes are laid out the way Japanese is actually written: each character gets its own column of up to 5 large
  boxes read top-to-bottom, and columns fill the page **right-to-left** (`render()`'s `colRightX` cursor in the
  generator starts at the right margin and decreases) - a whole 行 (5 characters) at the default 5 repetitions
  each fills exactly one page edge-to-edge, one column per character, in their natural reading order. Single-
  character mode defaults to 15 repetitions instead (3 columns), using the leftover width for an optional
  example-word writing line - row/all mode has no such leftover space, so that option is disabled there. The
  model reference character at the top of each character's first column is a full box-sized cell (not a small
  aside label) and, like every faint trace-hint inside the boxes below it, is centered on the box with
  `_drawCenteredJp()` - measuring the actual glyph width via `font.widthOfTextAtSize()` rather than a hand-
  guessed offset. Example words reuse that exact same box-and-crosshair rule too: each character of the word
  gets its own box-sized cell in a vertical column (shrunk together, never dropped, if both words don't fit the
  leftover width at full size), not one word squeezed as plain text into a single wide box.
  Cross-linked with japanese.html via a small sub-nav row under each page's `<h1>`.
- `js/pdf-common.js` - shared page geometry constants, font loading, drawing helpers, download trigger
- `assets/fonts/NotoSansJP-Regular.ttf` - embedded Japanese font: a `fonttools pyftsubset` build of Noto Sans JP
  covering every ASCII + kana/kanji character this app's Japanese strings actually use (~250 glyphs, ~190KB).
  Embedded with `{ subset: false }` in `js/pdf-common.js` - pdf-lib/fontkit's own in-browser subsetter is
  unreliable on large CJK fonts (throws on the official ~40k-glyph CFF release, silently corrupts unrelated
  glyphs on a naive glyf conversion), so the font is pre-subsetted offline instead and embedded whole. If you add
  new fixed Japanese text anywhere, its characters need adding to that offline subset step or they'll render
  blank - see the git history around this file for the exact `pyftsubset`/`otf2ttf` commands used.
- `results.html` / `js/pdf-viewer.js` - shared PDF viewer page every "Generate" button opens in a new tab
  instead of downloading directly (renders the PDF with pdf.js, thumbnail rail + Print + Download; no ads,
  `noindex`). See "Adding a new worksheet tool" below.
- `answers.html` / `js/answers-viewer.js` - decodes and displays the answer QR code's payload (see
  "Answer-key QR code" below). No IndexedDB handoff like `results.html` - everything needed to
  render the page arrives in its own URL, since the QR is meant to be scanned on a phone with no prior visit
  to the site.
- `assets/css/site.css` - small set of utility classes Tailwind's CDN build can't express (dashed ad placeholders,
  bold worksheet index numbers, crosshair answer boxes)

## Running locally

Just open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the folder with any static file server
(`python -m http.server`, VS Code Live Server, etc.) - opening `math.html`/`japanese.html`
directly via `file://` also works since there's no backend.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages

1. Push this folder to a GitHub repo.
2. Repo Settings -> Pages -> Deploy from branch -> pick `main` / root.
3. Done - all asset paths are relative, no config needed.

## Ads

The site is linked to AdSense (publisher `ca-pub-6130154285914649`, verified via the `<script>` tag in every
page's `<head>` and `/ads.txt` at the site root).

Current placements (the result of an AdSense "low-value content / ads on screens without publisher content"
rejection - keep these rules when adding ads):
- `index.html`: one leaderboard (`#ad-slot-bottom-leaderboard`, slot `7285905093`) below the tool cards and
  the How it works / FAQ content.
- `math.html`, `japanese.html`, `japanese-practice.html`: two ads each - `#ad-slot-below-preview` (slot
  `7285905093`) at the bottom of the preview card, and `#ad-slot-in-article` (slot `7199305456`) between the
  2nd and 3rd sections of the guide article below the tool.
- **No ads** on `results.html`, `answers.html` (utility screens, also `noindex`), `about.html`, `privacy.html`,
  or `contact.html`.

Rules these placements follow:
- Never put two ad units next to each other with no content between them, at any viewport width. Check the
  *mobile* stacking order (CSS `order-*` classes), not just the desktop grid.
- Never put an ad directly next to a button or other control (the Generate button especially) - AdSense treats
  that as encouraging accidental clicks.
- Never style an ad to look like site content (e.g. as a tool card in the homepage grid).
- Keep at most two ad units per tool page; every ad must have real written content around it.
- Keep Auto ads **off** in the AdSense dashboard, so Google doesn't inject extra placements that break these rules.

`about.html`, `privacy.html` (required by AdSense: discloses Google's ad cookies), and `contact.html` are linked
from every page's footer. `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` are at the site root; add any new indexable page to
`sitemap.xml`.

All ad slot containers cap their height (`overflow-hidden` + a fixed height) rather than letting
`data-ad-format="auto"` reserve however much space it wants - useful right after linking a new AdSense account,
since ads may not start filling for hours to a couple weeks, and an unfilled `auto`-format slot can otherwise
reserve a very tall blank block while waiting.

Every ad slot is a plain `<div>` wrapping one `<ins>`/`<script>` pair, never inside a form or the preview grid
itself, so ad content can't overlap form fields or generated worksheet content. To wire up a new/replacement ad
unit, paste its snippet in place of the existing `<ins>`/`<script>` pair, e.g.:

```html
<div id="ad-slot-below-preview">
  <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-XXXX" data-ad-slot="XXXX"></ins>
  <script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script>
</div>
```

## Adding a new worksheet tool

Every "Generate" button opens the finished PDF in `results.html` (a new tab, ad-free PDF.js viewer) rather
than downloading it directly. `results.html` has no idea what subject generated the PDF - it only knows how to
render whatever bytes it's handed - so a new tool (e.g. a future writing-practice generator) gets this for free
by following the same three-step contract used by `math-ui.js`/`japanese-ui.js`:

1. In the Generate click handler, **before any `await`**, call `const resultTab = window.open('', '_blank');` -
   this must happen synchronously in direct response to the click, or the browser's popup blocker may treat a
   tab opened after your (async) PDF generation finishes as not user-initiated and block it.
2. Generate your PDF bytes with pdf-lib as usual.
3. Call `await openPdfResults(bytes, filename, '<your-tool>.html', '<Tool Label>', resultTab);` (from
   `js/pdf-common.js`) instead of `downloadPdfBytes(...)`. It hands the bytes off via IndexedDB and points
   `resultTab` at `results.html?id=...`; if IndexedDB is unavailable it falls back to a direct download so
   generation never breaks.

No changes to `results.html` or `js/pdf-viewer.js` are needed for a new tool.

## Answer-key QR code

Every worksheet page (not the answer-key pages - they already have the answers printed) can carry a second QR
code, in the header right under the worksheet-matching code (top-right), alongside the existing homepage QR at
bottom-right (which now has a small "Print more!" caption). Toggle: `#cfg-answerqr` on both math.html and
japanese.html, `config.include_answer_qr`, default on. Deliberately placed up in the header rather than the
bottom margin - a bottom-margin QR sits right where a student's hand rests while writing, risking a smudge that
makes it unscannable.

Since this whole site is static with no backend, the QR can't look anything up server-side - instead it encodes
a link to `answers.html` with the answer data itself packed into the URL: `buildAnswerQrUrl({ c, t, a })` in
`js/pdf-common.js` builds `answers.html?c=<code>&t=<title>&a=<base64url(answerString)>` - only the answer list
itself is base64'd (unavoidably non-ASCII for Japanese), the code/title travel as plain query params, and there's
no JSON wrapper (its braces/quotes/colons would otherwise get percent-escaped to 3x their size). `js/answers-viewer.js`
decodes it entirely client-side and renders a plain answer list (it also still understands the older single
`?d=<base64url JSON>` format, so an already-printed worksheet's QR doesn't dead-end). This targets parents
helping with homework: scan once, see the answers, no need to track down the teacher or dig up a saved PDF, and
no server cost since it's the same static hosting as everything else on this site.

Design notes - getting a QR that's actually legible on a phone at print size turned out to be the hard part,
not the encoding:
- The answer text per problem is deliberately terse: just the solved value (`_answerSummary()` in
  math-generator.js) for math, and for Japanese just the target-script answer with **no prompt half** - a
  plain comma list in grid reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom). Every kana character costs 3 UTF-8
  bytes, so dropping the redundant prompt roughly halves that payload - it matters far more for scannability
  here than it does for math's plain-ASCII digits. This only works because every kana cell is now stamped with
  a small bold index number (Times-Bold, same convention as the math tool's "1.", "2." problem numbers) - the
  Japanese grid used to carry no printed numbering at all, so an answers-page list read "Q1, Q2, ..." with
  nothing on the actual worksheet for a student to match it against. The cell numbers and the QR/answers-page
  numbering are the same reading-order sequence, so "Q1" on the answers page now always means the box printed
  "1". The number is drawn just *outside* the answer box's top-left corner, in the margin between the box and
  the cell edge - never inside the box (that would eat into the one place a student needs full room to write)
  and never stacked above the prompt (the cell's vertical budget has no slack for that). `boxSize` is capped at
  `cellWidth * 0.75`, so there's always at least `cellWidth * 0.125` of margin on each side by construction;
  the number shrinks to fit whatever sliver that leaves (down to 5pt on a narrow many-column grid) rather than
  assuming a fixed size. The prompt is drawn slightly smaller (20pt -> 17pt) purely for a little clearance
  above it; the answer box keeps its **exact original size** - shrinking that would make it cramped to
  actually write a character in.
- The QR is drawn at error-correction level `'L'` (least redundant) instead of the default `'M'` -  fewer
  redundant bits means a smaller QR version for the same data, which is what actually determines module count.
- The QR's physical size is derived from its **actual module count**, not guessed from string length -
  `sizeQrForData()` in `js/pdf-common.js` builds the real QR object first, then sizes the box so each module
  lands near a target size (~1.3pt/~0.46mm), clamped to what the header has room for (46-64pt). If the payload
  is so dense that even the max size can't keep modules above a legibility floor (~0.85pt/~0.3mm), the QR is
  skipped entirely rather than drawn too small to scan - the homepage QR and the full printed answer-key page
  are always still there as a fallback.
- The QR is anchored at the very top of the header (right of the title) and gets first claim on the header's
  vertical space; the worksheet-matching code is drawn small (8pt), *below* the QR rather than above it. It was
  the other way around originally, which on a denser worksheet left the QR squeezed into whatever space was
  left under the code text - not enough, so it ended up touching the problem grid below it.
- **`answers.html` renders fully untrusted input.** Its query params are attacker-controllable (anyone can craft
  a link), so `js/answers-viewer.js` HTML-escapes every decoded value before inserting it into the page - never
  pass decoded payload content through `innerHTML` unescaped if you touch this file.

## Kana adjacency guard

Kana are placed on the grid randomly, so nothing inherently stops two or three adjacent cells from spelling
something inappropriate when read left-to-right or top-to-bottom - a real risk once a grid gets big enough
(measured empirically at ~9% of trials on a dense 10x5 mixed-direction grid before this guard existed).
`RandomizationEngine._sanitizeGrid()` in `js/japanese-generator.js` scans the finished grid for any
horizontal/vertical run matching `KANA_ADJACENCY_BLACKLIST` (checked via each cell's hiragana reading,
regardless of whether the grid displays katakana or hiragana prompts, since they read the same either way) and
swaps one cell in the offending run with another random cell elsewhere in the grid - only keeping the swap if
it doesn't just create a new violation at either swapped position. It's a short, curated list of clearly
inappropriate items, not general profanity/slang filtering, and it only runs in the randomized/mixed-order
path - sequential ("in order") mode lays out a fixed canonical a-i-u-e-o / ka-ki-ku-ke-ko layout that swapping
would break, and which never spells anything problematic in that order anyway.

## Notes on the port

- No `eval()`/`new Function()` anywhere. The math tool's mixed-continuous-equation feature (which used Python's
  `eval()` on a string) is replaced with `evalTokens()` in `js/math-generator.js`, a small recursive-descent
  evaluator operating directly on the token array (numbers/operators/parens) with standard precedence.
- PDF coordinate math (page 595.28x841.89pt, MARGIN=40, HEADER_HEIGHT=100, per-cell font-size scaling formulas,
  box/line drawing) is ported 1:1 from the Python hand-rolled PDF byte writer into pdf-lib calls - pdf-lib uses
  the same bottom-left-origin coordinate system as raw PDF, so the arithmetic translates directly.
- Both tools now generate a single combined PDF (worksheet pages followed by answer-key pages), matching the
  Python apps' `combined_pdf=True` default path.
- Problem index numbers ("1.", "2.") are rendered in Times-Bold (matching the Python renderer's "F3" font) in
  both the PDF and the live HTML preview (`.worksheet-index` in `assets/css/site.css`), so they're never
  confused with equation digits.
- Every generated PDF gets a small "Powered by Ys Learning Lab" footer line plus a QR code (bottom-right, at
  `y=20` so it clears the paper edge even on printers with a tight unprintable margin - a partially-clipped QR
  code is unscannable, unlike text, which degrades more gracefully; `drawQrCode()` in `js/pdf-common.js`)
  linking back to the site's homepage - drawn as plain filled rectangles from the
  [qrcode-generator](https://github.com/kazuhikoarase/qrcode-generator) CDN library's module matrix, not a
  raster image, consistent with how everything else in these renderers is hand-drawn. Wrapped in a try/catch so
  a CDN hiccup degrades to "no QR code" rather than breaking generation.
- Every generated worksheet (and its matching answer key) is stamped with a worksheet-matching code, e.g.
  `XRGD0831-A-1` (`getWorksheetBatchCode()` in `js/pdf-common.js`) - 4 random uppercase letters plus today's
  date (`MMDD`), freshly generated per "Generate" click, with a `-A-N` page suffix. Embedding the date means a
  code from one day's print run can never be confused with a code from a different day using the same settings
  (a real classroom scenario: the same worksheet config run daily would otherwise print the same code every
  time). The same per-page code appears on both the worksheet page and its corresponding answer-key page so a
  teacher can pair a stack of student worksheets to their answer keys by eye.
- Every worksheet header also has Name/Date/Teacher/Class fill-in lines for students to fill in before turning
  a sheet in - except the answer-key pages, which drop Name/Date/Class (the teacher doesn't need those on their
  own key) and keep only the Teacher line. On the Japanese tool these are English-only (Helvetica) even though
  the sheet is otherwise bilingual, specifically to avoid needing to re-run the offline Noto Sans JP subsetting
  pipeline for new kanji. The header is a compact 3-4 line block with a small title line instead of the
  original oversized heading, to leave more of the page for the actual worksheet grid -
  `PDF_PAGE.HEADER_HEIGHT` (currently `150`) is sized with real margin for the *worst case* (the answer QR at
  its max size, stacked with a page's densest row-0 text ascending above its own baseline), not just the
  common case, after a too-tight header let the QR/code visibly collide with the first problem row on some
  worksheets.
- The worksheet title and teacher name are editable form fields (`#cfg-title`/`#cfg-teacher` on both
  math.html and japanese.html, threaded through as `config.title`/`config.teacher`) instead of hardcoded text -
  Title defaults to "Math Practice Test" / "Kana Practice Test" and is printed as-is (with " - Answer Key"
  appended on the math tool's answer-key pages); Teacher prints the typed name directly when given, or falls
  back to a blank fill-in line like Name/Date/Class when left empty. Both round-trip through INI export/import.
- The math tool now has the same optional settings footer the Japanese tool already had
  (`#cfg-footer` / `config.show_settings_footer`, `MathPDFRenderer._settingsSummary()` in
  `js/math-generator.js`) - a small gray line summarizing layout/mode/randomization, and the "Powered by..."
  footer now also states PRACTICE SHEET vs ANSWER KEY like the Japanese tool's does.

## Cache-busting local script/style changes

Every `<script src="js/...">` and the `site.css` link carries a `?v=N` query param. **Bump it whenever you edit
that file** - browsers cache these aggressively with no other cache-control here, and without bumping the
version, visitors (and you, testing) can silently keep running old JS/CSS after a deploy. Cache-busting is
per-file-type, not global: all `js/*.js` references share one number (`?v=18` currently), `site.css` has its own
(`?v=7` currently) - bump whichever group you actually touched.
